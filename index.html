                My name is Spencer Yates and I am currently a Sophomore Applied Software Engineering student at Northern
                Kentucky University. Currently, my plans for what I want to do after I graduate will be teaching high
                school introductory programming courses. I currently volunteer at a nearby high school called the Ignite
                Institute and help mentor their robotics team. This experience plus having worked as a Camp Counselor in
                the past has made me realise the joys of teaching.

                I also currently compete in competitive robotics here at Northern Kentucky University. I am the
                president and founder of the organization known as NUKE Robotics. We compete in a competition called <a

                    Robotics</a> and specifically the VEXU section of the competition. We are also currently ranked as
                the #1 team in the world for the <a

            <p>
                Along with competing in robotics, I am an avid soccer fan. I have been a supporter of Borussia Dortmund
                for roughly 13 years. I also support Louisville City FC and frequently go to their games. I also enjoy
                watching NKU soccer games from time to time when I am available.
